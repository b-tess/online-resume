        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am a self-taught full-stack programmer with a knack for and
            curiosity about solution-finding. Self-governance is a strong suit.
            I am looking to join a team where the recently acquired knowledge
            and skills can be put to good use while also being furthered.

                                Contributed ideas towards the nursing procedures
                                and triage system workflow, as this is a startup
                                clinic. These ideas were then implemented by the
                                development team. Thus improving patient data
                                flow from registration to exit by 20%.

                                Worked with the resident software developer to
                                come up with a nursing inventory management
                                system which introduced me to back-end
                                development. This helped provide better stock
                                accountability and avoid stock run-out. It also
                                provided an avenue to showcase my meticulous
                                nature.
